| `SMTP_SECURE`   | `false` for port 587, `true` for port 465        |
| `SMTP_USER`     | Your Gmail or SMTP username                      |
| `SMTP_PASS`     | Gmail App Password (not your account password)   |
| `CONTACT_TO`    | Where contact form emails are delivered          |
| `RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY` | Public key — also replace in `index.html`  |
| `RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY` | Private key — server-side verification   |
| `GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` | Google Analytics ID (e.g. `G-XXXXXXXXXX`)  |

### reCAPTCHA v3 Setup
1. Go to [google.com/recaptcha/admin](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin)
2. Create a new site → choose **reCAPTCHA v3**
3. Add your domain (and `localhost` for dev)
4. Copy the **Site Key** → replace `RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY` in `public/index.html` (two places) and set as Railway env var
5. Copy the **Secret Key** → set as `RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY` Railway env var

### Gmail App Password Setup
1. Go to [myaccount.google.com/apppasswords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)
2. Create a new App Password for "Mail"
3. Use that 16-character password as `SMTP_PASS`

## Deploying to Railway

1. Push this repo to GitHub
2. In Railway: **New Project → Deploy from GitHub repo**
3. Add all environment variables under **Variables**
4. Railway auto-detects Node.js and runs `npm start`
5. Assign a custom domain under **Settings → Networking**

### Update Google Analytics
In `public/index.html`, replace both instances of `G-XXXXXXXXXX` with your real GA Measurement ID. Or set `GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` as an env var and inject it server-side if preferred.

## Contact Form

The contact form POSTs to `/contact` (rate-limited to 5 submissions per IP per 15 min).  
Emails arrive formatted with all fields: name, email, interest, experience level, and message.  
The reply-to is set to the sender's email so you can reply directly from your inbox.
